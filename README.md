Preface: This Add-on only works with the Bizhawk Emulator, as it relies on the ability to draw images in the emulator window, and specifically with the "Stadium" iconset. A big thank you to KiakoLee, StreamingFalcon, and Ice_ArchAngel for the original brows which inspired this project.

-------------------
INSTRUCTIONS: Gen 3
-------------------
1) Extract the contents of the unzipped Gen3Brows.zip file into the Tracker's extensions folder (i.e. "Ironmon-Tracker\extensions")
2) When the Tracker is running, go to Settings -> Setup -> Extensions -> make sure "Allow custom code to run" is enabled, and click on "Pokemon Stadium Brows" to enable the brows Add-on. If the brows option is not present you may need to click Refresh first.
3) Switch to the Stadium icon set by going to Settings -> Setup -> Using the arrows next to the example image
-------------------
INSTRUCTIONS: Gen 4
-------------------
1) Copy all .lua files from the unzipped Gen4Brows.zip into your NDS Tracker's UI folder (i.e. "NDS-Ironmon-Tracker\ironmon_tracker\ui\"), replacing existing files as necessary
2) Copy the 'brows' folder from the unzipped Gen4Brows.zip into your NDS-tracker's images folder (i.e. "NDS-Ironmon-Tracker\ironmon_tracker\images\")
3) Clicking the Pokemon's icon will toggle the brows on and off.

If you ever run into any problems with either version, feel free to raise a Github Issue.

Enjoy!
