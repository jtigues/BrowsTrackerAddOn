Preface: This Add-on only works with the Bizhawk Emulator, as it relies on the ability to draw images in the emulator window. A big thank you to KiakoLee, StreamingFalcon, and Ice_ArchAngel for the original brows which inspired this project, and for helping with its Gen 4 Tracker trial run

-------------------
INSTRUCTIONS: Gen 3
-------------------
1) Extract the contents of the unzipped Gen3Brows.zip file into the Tracker's Custom folder (i.e. "Ironmon-Tracker\ironmon-tracker\Custom")
2) Add "Brows.lua" to settings.filenames in CustomCodeSettings.lua
3) Again in CustomCodeSettings.lua, set settings.enabled to "true" (without the quotes)

-------------------
INSTRUCTIONS: Gen 4
-------------------
1) Copy all .lua files from the unzipped Gen4Brows.zip into your NDS Tracker's UI folder (i.e. "NDS-Ironmon-Tracker\ironmon_tracker\ui\"), replacing existing files as necessary
2) Copy the 'brows' folder from the unzipped Gen4Brows.zip into your NDS-tracker's images folder (i.e. "NDS-Ironmon-Tracker\ironmon_tracker\images\")
3) Clicking the Pokemon's icon will toggle the brows on and off.

If you ever run into any problems with either version, feel free to raise a Github Issue.

Enjoy!
