Preface: This Add-on only works with the Bizhawk Emulator, as it relies on the ability to draw images in the emulator window, and specifically with the "Stadium" iconset. A big thank you to KiakoLee, StreamingFalcon, and Ice_ArchAngel for the original brows which inspired this project.

-------------------
INSTRUCTIONS: Gen 3
-------------------
1) Extract the contents of the unzipped Gen3Brows.zip file into the Tracker's extensions folder (i.e. "Ironmon-Tracker\extensions")
2) When the Tracker is running, go to Settings -> Setup -> Extensions -> make sure "Allow custom code to run" is enabled, and click on "Pokemon Stadium Brows" to enable the brows Add-on. If the brows option is not present you may need to click Refresh first.
3) Switch to the Stadium icon set by going to Settings -> Setup -> Using the arrows next to the example image
4) By default, the brows will raise/lower every 8 frames, and will decrease their speed as your frame rate increases to avoid "turbo brows". If you would like to change the brow raising frequency or ignore the frame rate speed reduction, you can modify "defaultFrames" to a different frame count or set "allowTurbo" to "true" respectively, in Brows.lua

INSTRUCTIONS: Gen 4
-------------------
Update: Now built into the tracker itself! (v5.2.0)
You can enable them by going to Settings -> Tracker Appearance -> Pokemon Icon Sets -> Checking the "Enable Brows" checkbox while the Stadium icon set is selected

Enjoy!
